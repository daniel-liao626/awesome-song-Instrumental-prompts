#   Awesome Song&instrumental Prompts 🚀 

Hey fellow music creators!
Welcome to the "Awesome-song&instrumental-prompts" repository! Recently, while building my AI music site [AnyMusic]( https://anymusic.ai),testing models like Suno,Mureka,and MiniMax,I’ve noticed a lot of people struggling to come up with the right prompts to generate the sound they’re going for. It can definitely be tough trying to describe your music ideas, and that trial and error can eat up a lot of time.
I used to face the same challenge, so I decided to compile this music prompts that have helped me streamline my music creation process.
In this repository,We hope you find these prompts useful! And we encourage you to add your own prompts to the list.

## How To Make Your Own Song (With AI!)
When it comes to making your own song, there are several essential elements that need to be considered. These elements include lyrics, melody, harmony, Tempo, and structure. Each of these components plays a crucial role in creating a memorable and cohesive song.

**Lyrics: Telling Your Story**

**Melody: The Catchy Tune**

**Harmony: Adding Depth and Texture**

**Tempo: The Heartbeat of the Song**

**Structure: Building a Solid Foundation**

Creating your own song involves a careful balance of lyrics, melody, harmony, Tempo, and structure. By understanding how these elements work together, you can create a song that engages your audience, tells a story, and leaves a lasting impression.

## Song Structure Basics 
Every song is built from a few common sections:

**Core (required)**

-   **Verse**: The **main part** of the song. Tells the story, develops the idea, provides details.
-   **Chorus (Hook)**: The **most memorable** part. Repeats the same lyrics/melody, usually the "catchy" highlight.

**Optional (use as needed)**

-   **Pre-Chorus**: Connects the verse to the chorus, builds anticipation.
-   **Bridge**: Provides contrast, new perspective, or tension before the final chorus.
-   **Intro**: Sets the mood and key at the beginning (instrumental or short lyrical).
-   **Outro**: Closes the song, often repeating phrases or fading out.
-   **Solo**: Instrumental or vocal solo section.

👉 **Simplest starter structure**:

'**A**' signifies verse '**B**' signifies the chorus.

**ABAB**： verse→chorus→verse→chorus

**AABAB**：Verse → Verse → Chorus → Verse → Chorus

## Best Practices for Prompting Lyrics

To get clear and consistent results:

-   **Be specific** – Clearly say you want lyrics.
-   **Specify vocals** – e.g. "clear female vocal, upfront in mix."
-   **Define structure** – Outline verse/chorus/bridge.
-   **Give a theme** – e.g. "love, heartbreak, nostalgia, party."
-   **Experiment & iterate** – Try variations until the result feels right.

## Best Practices for Prompting Music
The heart of AI music generation lies in the **prompt**. This is the textual instruction you provide to AI, outlining your desired musical style, instrumentation, tempo, and mood. The more descriptive you are, the better the AI can understand and respond.
Think of all the different ways you can describe a song: genre, mood, atmosphere, dynamics, instruments, tempo. These descriptors shape the output.
👉 Avoid vague terms like "good"or "interesting."Use rich, descriptive words like "ethereal" ,"dreamlike" ,"nostalgic",or "minimalist".

**Key Takeaways**
-   Start with **genre + style** (e.g., "synth-pop," "jazz," "cinematic").
-   Add **instruments** and **textures** (e.g., "jangly guitars," "sweeping strings").
-   Define **tempo** (slow, mid-tempo, fast, very fast).
-   Specify **mood/atmosphere** (nostalgic, dreamy, ominous, playful).
-   Include **details** for extra nuance (e.g., "walking bassline," "epic climax").

Experiment with combinations, refine, and iterate — each prompt is a creative starting point!
